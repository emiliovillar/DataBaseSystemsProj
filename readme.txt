# CSCI 3304 Term Project: Data for Breaking Barriers
## 🏠 Housing Affordability & Eviction Analysis

This project is a database-driven system for the CSCI 3304 "Data for Breaking Barriers" term project. Its goal is to highlight the barrier to affordable housing by analyzing the relationship between local demographics, housing costs, and eviction outcomes across the United States.

### 🚀 How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the ZIP)**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-git-repo-url-here]
    cd [your-project-folder-name]
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    This project requires `streamlit` and `pandas`.
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas
    ```

3.  **Build the Database (One-Time Setup)**
    Run the `setup.py` script. This will:
    * Create a new file named `project.db`.
    * Read the `final_project_data.csv`.
    * Populate the 4-table SQLite database with all 3,100+ county records.

    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```
    *(You only need to do this once.)*

4.  **Launch the Streamlit App**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your default web browser will automatically open with the running application.

### ✅ Current Features (Week 2 Deliverable)

* **Relational Database:** A 4-table SQLite database (`project.db`) has been designed and populated.
* **Database Schema:**
    * `Counties`: The central "hub" table (PK: `fips`).
    * `Demographics`: Contains population, race, and income data (FK: `fips`).
    * `Housing`: Contains median rent and rent-burdened data (FK: `fips`).
    * `Evictions`: Contains eviction filing data (FK: `fips`).
* **Full CRUD Functionality:** The main page provides full Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the `Evictions` table.
